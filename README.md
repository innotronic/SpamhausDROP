# SpamhausDROP
This System V init script fetches and adds or removes the [Spamhaus DROP IP blacklist](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/) to/from the routing table.
It combines the DROP, EDROP and DROPv6 list.
A daily cron job triggers refreshing.

## Usage
Just install the RPM and start the services a first time:

    service SpamhausDROP start

Check if the DROP list is active:

    service SpamhausDROP status

Force refreshing the list:

    service SpamhausDROP refresh

Remove blacklist:

    service SpamhausDROP stop 


## Build
If you like, build the RPM on your own:

  rpmbuild --rebuild SpamhausDROP-x.x-1.src.rpm
